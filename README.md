## 1. Introduction

CSLabs is a virtual lab learning environment created and operated by the Indiana University Southeast (IUS) Computer Security Group (CSG). It is used by IUS faculty and students to practice computer security and learn other aspects of computer science using virtual machines (VM). 
The CSLabs 2020 Capstone project is an extension of the previous year’s Capstone projects. The extension project does not aim to overhaul the existing system architecture.
